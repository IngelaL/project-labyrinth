# Project Labyrinth

Max Forssén and Ingela Löfgren worked together in pair-programming in this project. We have built a labyrinth game with Redux and API-calls. 

## The problem

We have used html, javascript, styled components, React, Redux with thunks and batch. We have fetched backend from an API call.

First we made a scetch in Figma and planned the project, for example which components and reducers to use. The second step was to set up the basics, setting up the store and createSlice. 
After that we tried to make the game work which was a bit tricky. A challenge was to connect user name and to dispatch the actions after eachother and not simultanously.
The next challenge was to make the second call and to make the player continue the game. Last step was to make the site responsive and styled.
